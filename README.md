# Transporationprice
Machine Learning project 


Welcome to our project

Objective:
Develop a model to predict the price of a ride based on factors such as distance, location, ride type, weather conditions, and time.

Useful Features:

-price: Target variable for prediction.
-distance: Ride distance (directly impacts price).
-surge_multiplier: Surge pricing multiplier, which increases prices during high demand periods.
-name: Ride type (e.g., Lyft, Lyft XL, Lux, etc.), which may indicate different pricing structures.
-hour, day, month, timezone: To capture temporal patterns (rush hours, weekdays vs. weekends, etc.).
-temperature, windSpeed, visibility, precipitation: Weather conditions that may influence demand and pricing.
-latitude, longitude: Location may affect pricing due to traffic density or regionalÂ demand.
